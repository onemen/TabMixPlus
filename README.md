**Tab Mix Plus** is a very popular _legacy_ extension for the Mozilla Firefox browser that enhances Firefox's tab browsing abilities. It includes such features as duplicating tabs, controlling tab focus, tab clicking options, undo closed tabs and windows, plus much more.<br/>
**Session Manager** feature is not included at the moment since it requires complete rewrite.

## Installation
1. **_Legacy_ extensions loader**<br/>
Since Firefox removed the internal component that loads _legacy_ extension, in order to install **Tab Mix Plus**, or any other _legacy_ extension, you have to install 3rd party helper script/extension.<br/>
The develpoer of these script/extension recomend using the first option:
     * If you're using normal Firefox (aka "stable" or "release"), Beta or ESR, you need to install this script [userChromeJS](https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts#instructions). 
     * [bootstrapLoader.xpi](https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts/tree/master/extensions/bootstrapLoader) extension  is an option for those who use [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/) or [Firefox Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly).

<br/>

2. **Donwload XPI**<br/>
    Donwload xpi file from our [releases](https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus/releases) page to your local computer.
    >If you are using Firefox Beta, Developer Edition or Nightly we recommend using the latest **Tab Mix Plus** _development build_ (tags with **pre** in the title)

<br/>

3. **Install XPI**<br/>
