<hr />

**Tab Mix Plus** is a very popular _legacy_ extension for the Mozilla Firefox browser that enhances Firefox's tab browsing abilities. It includes such features as duplicating tabs, controlling tab focus, tab clicking options, undo closed tabs and windows, plus much more.

**Session Manager** feature is not included at the moment since it requires complete rewrite.

## Installation

1. **_Legacy_ extensions loader**<br />
Since Firefox removed the internal component that loads _legacy_ extension, in order to install **Tab Mix Plus**, or any other _legacy_ extension, you have to install 3rd party helper scripts. If you are using Waterfox, you can skip this and proceed to step 2.

   1.1. Open `about:support` and locate the path to your **Application Binary** and **Profile Folder**.

   <details>
     <summary>Linux</summary>

     **Note**:
     The default path to Firefox on Linux is typically `/usr/lib/firefox/`.

     **Verify the path**:

     Check the actual path to your Firefox **Application Binary**.
     If it differs from `/usr/lib/firefox/`, replace the path accordingly in the following instructions.

     **Copy the configuration files extracted from `fx-folder.zip`**:

     * copy `config.js` to `/usr/lib/firefox/config.js`
     * copy `config-prefs.js` to `/usr/lib/firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/config-prefs.js`
   </details>

     **Instructions for Firefox snap 108 or newer**

     **Verify installation path**:

     If you're uncertain about the installation path of your Firefox snap, use the command `snap list firefox` in your terminal to check.

     **Copy the configuration files extracted from `fx-folder.zip`**:

     * copy `config.js` to `/etc/firefox/config.js`
     * copy `config-prefs.js` to `/etc/firefox/defaults/pref/config-prefs.js`


     **Create subfolders if necessary**

     If the folders /defaults or /pref don't exist within /etc/firefox/ create them.
   </details>

   <details>

     **Note**:

     The default path to Firefox on MacOs is typically `Firefox.app/Contents/Resources`.
